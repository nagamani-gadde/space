        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) is India's national space agency, founded on August 15, 1969, with its headquarters in
            &nbsp;Bengaluru.
            It replaced the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), which had been established in 1962
            under the &nbsp;Department of Atomic Energy at the suggestion of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, widely regarded as the
            father of the Indian space program.
            &nbsp;Early History and Founding Satellite research in India began in the early 1960s when global satellite
            applications were in their infancy.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Vikram Sarabhai led
            the effort to harness space technology for addressing real-life challenges in India, primarily
            communication, &nbsp;broadcasting, meteorology, and resource management.
            INCOSPAR's first notable accomplishment was the launch of a sounding rocket &nbsp;from the Thumba Equatorial
            Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963. was set up in 1969 to expand the vision and activities
            &nbsp;established under INCOSPAR, and later brought under the newly formed Department of Space in 1972.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major Milestones
            ISRO launched its first satellite, Aryabhata, with the help of the Soviet Union on April 19, 1975.
            In 1980, ISRO successfully launched the Rohini satellite (RS-1) using an indigenous launch vehicle (SLV-3),
            making India the seventh nation to achieve this feat.In 1980, ISRO successfully launched the Rohini
            satellite (RS-1) using an indigenous launch vehicle (SLV-3), making India the seventh nation to achieve this
            feat.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space agency
            developed and expanded its capabilities with a range of rockets: the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), the
            Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), and the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), as well as
            their variants for different orbits and payloads.Key Programs and Achievements
            The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT), launched in 1988, revolutionized India's telecommunications
            and broadcasting sectors, alongside the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) program for resource monitoring.Landmark
            missions include
            Chandrayaan-1 (2008), India's first lunar orbiter; Mangalyaan or Mars Orbiter Mission (2013), which made
            India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit; Chandrayaan-2 (2019), and Chandrayaan-3 (2023).
            In January 2025, ISRO successfully performed its first space docking experiment, making India the fourth
            country to demonstrate this technology.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structure and
            Contributions
            ISRO operates through a network of research, development, and mission centers, with the main ones being
            Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), U R Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), and
            others across India.Its achievements span satellite design, launch vehicles, remote sensing, navigation
            (IRNSS/NavIC), meteorology, and international collaborations. ISRO is also preparing for its first manned
            mission, Gaganyaan, targeted for launch in 2026.
